# Weather-App 
## One of my initial projects. Done back then in 2021. 
### It gave me a lot of pleasure and I learned a lot of new and exciting things while creating it. It's not perfect, but I'd like to keep it on GitHub as it is :)



The purpose of the application is to create an anpp that will monitor the weather in the user's current location and around the world.

The app also provides three fully interactive worldwide maps with below informations:

- temperature
- precipitation
- cloudiness
